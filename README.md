Machine Learning Strategies applied to 2D/3D Videogames using Python.
===================================

This project contains a set of scripts developed from January to September 2019 regarding my final Bachelor thesis. For this project our main goal was to test different existing reinforcement
learning algorithms to study how the different learning architectures and game environments may affect the learning processes.
